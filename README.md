# Three Fives Discrete 555 Timer Kit

## Overview

The Three Fives kit is a faithful, transistor‑scale replica of the classic NE555 timer IC, one of the most iconic and popular integrated circuits ever made. This open‑source hardware project by Evil Mad Scientist is designed for education, art, and DIY electronics enthusiasts. Assemble individual transistors, resistors, and diodes to build a fully functional discrete 555 timer and gain hands‑on insight into analog circuit design.

Distributed through the Evil Mad Scientist Shop, this kit supports art, education, and accessibility initiatives.

## Features

- **Transistor‑Scale Replica**  
  Fully functional discrete implementation of the NE555 using 22 transistors, 15 resistors, and 2 diodes.

- **Educational Tool**  
  Learn the inner workings of the 555 timer and analog electronics through hands‑on assembly.

- **Versatile Applications**  
  Use in astable oscillators, monostable one‑shot timers, PWM generators, and more.

- **Open‑Source Hardware**  
  Complete schematics, PCB layouts, and documentation available for study and modification.

- **Through‑Hole Design**  
  Easy to assemble with standard soldering tools; suitable for beginners and experienced builders.

- **Compact Size**  
  PCB measures approximately 2.6 × 1.3 inches, ideal for embedding into your own projects.
